Example of how to continuously deploy a CV written in LaTeX to a personal website in a different git repo.

* [erikw/cvcd-latex](https://github.com/erikw/cvcd-latex) - The CV LaTeX source project. 
* [erikw/cvcd-website](https://github.com/erikw/cvcd-website) - Personal website (GitHub pages hosted Jekyll) to where the `cv.pdf` is deployed to.

# The Website
This is a simple statically generated Jekyll site hosted at GitHub Pages.

The website can be viewed at https://erikw.github.io/cvcd-website/ and the `cv.pdf` is accessible at https://erikw.github.io/cvcd-website/cv.pdf.
